  <p>{{gettext("Throughout 2020, we built and iterated upon Origin’s flagship commerce platform, <a href='/dshop' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Dshop</a>. Dshop is a completely open-source alternative to Shopify, and all its core features are free to use. Today, we’ve had hundreds of merchants sign up to use Dshop, including dozens of name brand cryptocurrency companies such as Brave, Solana, and Kyber Network.")}}</p>

  <p>{{gettext("Further, we announced marquee partnerships with <a href='https://medium.com/google-cloud/origin-launches-decentralized-commerce-on-google-cloud-marketplace-b74fb46be7d9' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Google Cloud</a> and <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/launch-a-blockchain-powered-ecommerce-store-with-dshop-in-aws-marketplace/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Amazon</a> to enable our merchant partners to launch completely decentralized storefronts on these iconic cloud computing platforms. We are working with both companies to promote Dshop to additional merchants with co-marketing initiatives. We are also working with the Google team to make Dshop’s blockchain commerce data more readily accessible in Google Data Studio.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("We’ve also made OUSD a supported payment option on all our Dshops to begin turning the flywheel for OUSD adoption by merchants.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("While we continue to see increased usage of Dshop, we believe that introducing new killer use cases that are crypto-centric will rocket Dshop adoption to new heights.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Our initial focus on creating features and tackling verticals that incumbents like Shopify and Woo Commerce cannot compete in will center on non-fungible tokens (NFTs). We believe NFTs are a nascent but highly disruptive technology that will bring our crypto-centric commerce products to millions, if not hundreds of millions, of users in the next few years. At the time of writing, Origin’s NFT Launchpad set an all-time record for gross sales in a single NFT drop at nearly $11.7M.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("In January of 2021, NFTs accounted for a record <a href='https://decrypt.co/56998/crypto-art-sales-on-ethereum-reach-a-record-80-million' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>$80M of transaction volume</a>. It is clear that NFT sales are growing at an exponential rate and represent the fastest growing opportunity for crypto-centric commerce.")}}</p>
  <!-- Image here -->
  <p>{{gettext("However, we believe that the majority of the market misconstrues NFTs as simply scarce digital art. At Origin, we believe NFTs are the crypto-centric building blocks that bridge fungible payment currencies like OUSD to multiple billion dollar opportunities.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Origin’s NFT Launchpad will redefine commerce in several key verticals.")}}</p>

  <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("NFTs that are redeemable for offline goods")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("In May 2020, Grammy-winning DJ RAC released his $TAPE NFTs that were redeemable for physical cassette tapes. Little did he know that he would be setting the record for the final sale price of a single cassette tape, as $TAPE tokens redeemable for the cassette tapes eventually cleared $3,000 per token.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("This is just one example of how NFTs have changed the landscape for limited-edition premium products. NFTs that represent physical offline goods can be authenticated on the blockchain. Influencers, artists, creators, and other merchants can now issue NFTs that are both certifiably scarce and representative of valuable physical items.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("There is an enormous opportunity to use NFTs to power these creator communities. Because NFTs are freely exchangeable on the blockchain, they also inherently create an after-market for limited edition goods. ")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("One needs only to reference StockX, the premium sneaker marketplace that is currently valued at $2.8 B, to recognize the possibility of NFTs flourishing in many verticals where scarcity and authenticity need to be enforced. Today, the company generates $400M in revenue by taking fees to certify that premium sneakers are legitimate and not fraudulent. Using NFTs that are tied to these sneakers would establish a clear sense of provenance as sneakers are sold from one buyer to the next.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("In another manifestation of using NFTs connected to offline products, the limited goods do not need to be redeemed. For example, a collector can purchase an NFT that entitles them with the rights to redeem that NFT for fine art, luxury handbags, or other products but can store that product with the original manufacturer. Redemption can happen at any point in the future. Again, because NFTs are exchangeable, collectors could invest in luxury items with the hopes of these items appreciating in value. However, they no longer need to take physical delivery and can simply sell the NFTs representing the items in an after market to profit from their investments.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Taking this one model one step further, NFT-powered commerce can generate revenue even before products are developed or manufactured. In the web 2.0 world, we saw how crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Gofundme were able to generate demand for creator projects. In the web 3.0, NFTs can be a better form to issue ownership of future redeemable products. Once again, because these NFTs are freely exchangeable they provide backers the ability to resell their ownership even before the projects are completed.")}}</p>


  <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("NFTs that access digital content")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("We intend to release NFT features that also provide holders access to digital content and services. For example, content providers can replace paywall subscriptions with NFT ownership. Users that have purchased NFTs can unlock premium articles, unreleased music, premium video content, or special features in social and mobile games.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Here are a few examples of how this might work. Today, Patreon influencers allow their super fans to access unique content through the platform. The company generates $50M of revenue and is currently valued at $1.2B. However, these subscriptions and individual payments are tied to unique users. In tomorrow’s world, creators can issue NFTs that unlock special video or music content instead.")}}</p>
  
  <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("NFTs that are access tokens")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("A third opportunity that is a multi-billion dollar opportunity in NFT-powered commerce lies in experiential commerce. NFTs that are certifiable on the blockchain can guarantee authenticity of tickets for professional sports, concerts, and other live performances. This reduces the risk of fraudulent tickets and also maintains clear provenance of ticket resales.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Going back to the Patreon example, a creator NFT may enable a user to get a 1-on-1 video chat with their favorite celebrity. Another user can purchase a premium NFT that grants them backstage access to their favorite musicians concerts for life.")}}</p>

  <div id="dshopNFTlaunchpad">
    <h2>{{gettext("Dshop NFT Launchpad")}}</h2>
    <p>{{gettext("The key to unlocking value in all of these crypto-centric opportunities with NFTs is making NFT issuance dead simple for creators. In addition, in contrast to existing players in the market like Nifty Gateway, we believe the creators should own the branding and have direct control over pricing models (e.g. different auction mechanics or tiered pricing). The Dshop NFT Launchpad gives creators and influencers more direct control over their content and their physical, digital, and experiential products. Just as many merchants have chosen Shopify over selling on generic marketplaces that do not allow for custom branding and direct relationships to end customers, we believe the same model will be successful for NFTs.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("All three aforementioned NFT-powered commerce opportunities are already supported by our platform. These use cases were highlighted in our recent NFT successful Dshop NFT Launchpad collaboration with world-famous DJ and crypto-currency influencer 3LAU who is ranked #93 on CoinTelegraph’s list of most influential people in cryptocurrency in 2020. Almost $11.7M of gross sales were generated using Origin’s commerce platform in our inaugural campaign, a sum that smashed the previous record for a single NFT collection. Coverage of this record breaking event reached mainstream media outlets like the <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/nft-nba-top-shot-crypto.html' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>New York Times</a> and <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2021/03/03/3lau-nft-nonfungible-tokens-justin-blau/?sh=17043b94643b' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Forbes</a>.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Similarly, with Origin’s ever-deepening relationship with Brave, we enabled them to sell their NFTs on their existing Dshop. Their entire first collection sold out in minutes. We anticipate additional NFT-centric commerce opportunities with the exponentially growing browser company that already boasts 20M monthly active users (MAU).")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("In the near future, we intend to form additional partnerships with additional mainstream influencers and iconic brands to power their NFT commerce initiatives. We believe there is a huge untapped market for monetizing premium, limited-edition online and offline goods and services through our latest NFT product upgrades to the Origin Platform.")}}</p>

    <h2>{{gettext("NFT Marketplace")}}</h2>
    <p>{{gettext("Secondary market sales are vital for true price discovery of NFTs and the maturation of this nascent market. We intend to build a marketplace platform for secondary market sales of all NFTs launched on the [Origin NFT Auction Platform] as well NFTs from other platforms and marketplaces. The Origin team already has over 4 years of experience building peer-to-peer marketplace technology and we are the leaders in this field. The Origin Marketplace protocol was launched on Ethereum mainnet in 2018 and supported tens of thousands of users and listings for a variety of goods and services. Origin fully intends on being the NFT marketplace leader and capturing NFT sales from our partner creators as well as creators who launch independently or with another platform.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("NFTs being based on a common set of decentralized technology standards makes building a marketplace that can serve the entire NFT ecosystem possible. Any moats deployed by other NFT marketplace operators will be quickly rendered ineffective as they are against the spirit of decentralization. Another important aspect to our platform is that these secondary marketplaces can be run and curated by the NFT creators themselves. Gallerists and artists have always cared deeply about presentation and curation as it can have a strong impact on the price of their assets. Letting creators control every aspect of their NFT from creation to secondary market sale is a key differentiator to Origin’s NFT platform over more generic NFT marketplaces. Fans of specific creators and artists will also appreciate going direct to the source instead of browsing through unrelated listings on a generalized marketplace.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Another reason creators should be excited about custom NFT marketplaces is that it allows them to better monetize their creations over a longer period of time. Artists will experience increased value capture from programmatic transaction fees attached to NFTs they create. This means that any secondary market sales will generate revenue for NFT creators in perpetuity. Previously, musical artists would only capture a small portion of this value through royalties and fine artists would capture no value from secondary sales.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Not only are secondary market sales important for price discovery, transaction fees from these sales will be one of the key revenue drivers for the [Origin NFT product] in the future. Far more volume is done on the secondary market than during initial sales and we expect record-breaking trades in the future. Origin intends to build a fully-featured NFT platform and ecosystem. We will develop the best end-to-end NFT platform in the space and capture massive value for our users, NFT creator partners, and our token holders.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("In 1999, Yu Pan, one of PayPal’s original co-founders conceived of creating “the new world currency”, complete with interest yielding strategies and debit cards without having to connect to traditional banking systems. Several pivots and an eBay acquisition later, PayPal dropped its ambitions in this area.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Two decades later, Yu Pan, Origin’s founding engineer, and the rest of the Origin team have finally launched this new world currency.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The Origin Dollar is the first cryptocurrency stablecoin that automatically and passively earns yield while sitting in cryptocurrency wallets. Users do not need to stake/unstake or provide liquidity to earn yields across underlying DeFi protocols. While past performance does not guarantee future results, to date OUSD has generated annualized yields between 20%% and 150%% at any given time.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD is a superior DeFi product for the masses. By removing all the complexities normally associated with earning fees through lending or supplying liquidity to automated market makers (AMMs), OUSD is highly accessible to users who are new to cryptocurrency technologies. Today, users need only to purchase OUSD on centralized exchanges or decentralized swap sites like Uniswap/Sushiswap to begin earning yield at staggering rates immediately. Alternatively, users can mint OUSD with their existing stablecoins (DAI, USDT, USDC currently) on the <a href='https://www.ousd.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>OUSD DApp</a>.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Current APYs and circulating supply are published transparently on the <a href='https://analytics.ousd.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>OUSD dashboard</a>. ")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("With OUSD, there’s no need to unwind complicated positions when you want to spend your OUSD. You can transfer it freely without having to pay gas to unlock spendable capital. In addition, OUSD gives you access to compelling opportunities across DeFi with none of the hassles. The OUSD smart contracts deploy your underlying capital to a diversified set of yield-earning strategies, rebalancing over time to achieve strong yields while diversifying risk. Earnings automatically accrue in your wallet and compound continuously while you hold OUSD. Again, no staking or lockups are required, making your OUSD as easy to transfer as any other ERC-20 token. OUSD also serves as an ideal unit of account. DeFi investors no longer need complicated spreadsheets to calculate their earnings as they can easily see their constantly updated OUSD balances in real-time.")}}</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase">{{gettext("Yield strategies")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD uses two high-level strategies for generating yield--lending and market making.")}}</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("Lending:")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("DeFi lending platforms let users lend and borrow crypto assets without any middlemen. Both lenders and borrowers get more value from their crypto. Lenders earn interest, while borrowers deposit crypto as collateral to gain access to credit without traditional banking headaches. DeFi lending platforms currently provide far superior returns for lenders than are generally available in the traditional markets.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD integrates with DeFi lending platforms that provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization, combined with smart rules around liquidations, provide a reasonable level of security for lenders. Aave also additionally secures their lending pools with AAVE tokens respectively, further lowering risk.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD integrates with leading lending providers that have a proven track record, audited smart contracts, and have successfully lent hundreds of millions of dollars without issue. We are currently integrated with Compound and Aave.")}}</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("Market making:")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Automated market makers (AMMs) have quickly risen as the preferred form of decentralized exchange on the Ethereum network. This is in part due to the difficulty of supporting order book DEXes on Ethereum 1.0 that can rival the instant and low-slippage experiences on centralized exchanges. Further, AMMs like Uniswap are relatively user-friendly and gas-efficient to use.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("AMMs can only enable new markets when liquidity providers supply liquidity (e.g. multiple tokens for given trading pairs or pools). In return for providing liquidity, liquidity providers are rewarded with trading fees when other users swap tokens. For example, when traders swap USDT for USDC on Uniswap, they are currently charged 0.3%% on top of gas fees. These fees are distributed pro-rata to liquidity providers on the USDT-USDC pair based on the percentage of total liquidity that they have provided.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The OUSD protocol routes USDT, USDC, and DAI to highly-performing liquidity pools as determined by trading volume and rewards tokens (e.g. Balancer rewards BAL tokens to liquidity providers). Yields are then passed on to OUSD holders. We are currently integrated with Curve and plan on integrating with Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Balancer in the near future.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("In addition to collecting interest from lending and fees from market making, we intend to automatically claim and convert the bonus incentives that are being distributed by many of the DeFi protocols. For example, Compound gives away COMP tokens, Balancer gives away BAL tokens, and Curve gives away CRV tokens. These bonus rewards will be regularly converted into stablecoins, deployed in the market, and distributed to OUSD holders in the form of additional yield.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD is able to generate higher yields than competing protocols due to a combination of important design decisions that amplify the rewards that are returned to OUSD holders:")}}</p>
    <ul>
      <li>{{gettext("Exit fees are returned to the pool, rewarding long term holders")}}</li>
      <li>{{gettext("Price oracles favor the collective over the individual, again rewarding long term holders")}}</li>
      <li>{{gettext("Smart contracts must manually opt-in to earn yield. This allows the protocol to put more capital to work than would be otherwise possible.")}}</li>

    </ul>

    <p>{{gettext("Readers can learn more about the technical details of OUSD on our <a href='https://docs.ousd.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>documentation</a>.")}}</p>
    
    <p class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase">{{gettext("Benefits of OUSD")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Mainstream cryptocurrency users now have the equivalent of a high-yield savings account automatically built into their Ethereum wallets whenever they are holding OUSD. This increases DeFi’s addressable user base from tens to hundreds of thousands of sophisticated users to tens of millions of users instantly. By comparison, Uniswap, the most widely used DeFi product to date has only interacted with approximately 250k Ethereum wallets since its inception.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Because OUSD makes it easy for consumers to switch between spending and savings mode, it can also become the ideal medium of exchange. Today, many merchants other than those dealing in black or grey markets do not have many incentives to accept cryptocurrencies. Because most consumers currently use credit cards and mobile payments, merchants are forced to accept payments predominantly with these methods. In the process, they are often charged a 2.90%% credit card processing fee, with other payment intermediaries (e.g. merchant bankers and interchange networks) also increasing the cost of doing business. ")}}</p>  
    <p>{{gettext("For merchants that have traditionally been skeptical of receiving cryptocurrency payments, being able to accept a yield-bearing stablecoin that beats traditional savings accounts and instantly earns yields at a minimum of 20%% APY is a powerful motivator. Instead of losing money on each sale, they are instantly adding capital to their merchant accounts that compounds instantly, giving them more operating capital over time. For merchants that oftentimes face cash flow management and inventory issues, being able to accept a yield-bearing form of payment is extremely compelling.")}}</p>  
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD creates the incentives for merchants to not only accept, but promote the usage of cryptocurrencies in their businesses. As more users hold and make purchases with OUSD, more merchants will similarly accept OUSD. These powerful network effects have the potential to gradually replace the payment rails for both online and offline commerce.")}}</p>  
    <p>{{gettext("In the short-term, OUSD’s target audience encompasses the millions of novice to intermediate cryptocurrency users in the world that are not yet invested in DeFi. An even larger opportunity lies in targeting the hundreds of millions of users that are currently using traditional peer-to-peer and merchant payment systems.")}}</p>  
    <p>{{gettext("Today, PayPal boasts over 305M consumers and 22M merchants and processes over $200B of payments in a single quarter. Our aspirations are to begin penetrating that customer base with OUSD and future payments applications built on top of the OUSD protocol in the upcoming year.")}}</p>  

    <p class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase">{{gettext("Business development")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The most obvious success metric for OUSD is its total circulating supply. As demand for OUSD grows, more OUSD will be minted and added to the total supply. DeFi protocols are often valued at a glance by the total dollar amount of value deposited into its smart contracts, or Total Value Locked (TVL). In order for OUSD to become successful, we must convince users to buy or mint OUSD, adding to its supply, and we must keep this OUSD held in user wallets or circulating instead of sold or redeemed for underlying stablecoins. Ease of access and network effects are two important factors in this. Direct incentives beyond industry leading APYs may also be a tool we implement in the future.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("To achieve greater circulating supply, it is imperative that we make OUSD available on every major DeFi platform, decentralized exchange, and centralized exchange. Increasing OUSD’s representation on decentralized platforms will solidify OUSD as a money lego and composable building block for DeFi. Having OUSD markets on popular centralized exchanges allows us to onboard the millions of crypto users who are not familiar with Web 3 wallets like MetaMask but who do have exchange accounts. Although there are some unique challenges to integrating rebasing tokens on these platforms, these challenges are not difficult to overcome and rebasing tokens are growing in popularity.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("We have plans to integrate OUSD as a collateral asset on major lending platforms such as Compound, Aave, and Cream. There are already millions of dollars of liquidity available for OUSD on Uniswap and Sushiswap. We intend to target stablecoin-focused AMMs such as Curve and Shell Protocol in the near future. On the centralized exchange side, we aim to have OUSD listed on every major exchange globally.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("To take OUSD truly mainstream, we must connect it with traditional financial infrastructure. The first step will be to get OUSD listed on exchanges that have fiat on and off-ramps. Enabling the direct purchase of OUSD with fiat currency in the form of bank transfers or credit card payments is also a priority for us. These connections to traditional finance are necessary in order for us to successfully launch the future products we have planned for OUSD.")}}</p>    

    <p class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase">{{gettext("Future products")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("We imagine a better future for online and offline payments that uses OUSD as the underlying payment rails. Below, we outline our vision for what we'd like to see built on top of the OUSD protocol.

    <p>{{gettext("Today peer-to-peer mobile payments account for trillions of dollars in transaction volume. In the United States, Venmo and Square Cash dominate. In China, cryptocurrency’s largest market by trading volume, Wechat and Alipay have near monopolistic holds on consumers and merchants. These simple, centralized payment apps are used by customers paying merchants and by friends and family transferring money to each other. Furthermore, in many markets, the US and Europe especially, bank cards are still the go-to way to spend money for online and offline transactions. Credit card companies, payment processors, and banks dominate this market and there are a variety of companies such as PayPal that assist merchants and consumers in using their cards online.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The billions of users using these existing payment methods have very little incentive to adopt cryptocurrency payments due to increased friction and lack of network effects.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("We believe a new peer-to-peer payment app with an associated debit card built on top of the OUSD protocol can disrupt incumbents. Today, Venmo users shuffle money between their Venmo accounts and their checking accounts and credit cards. In the case of the former, money sitting in Venmo or checking accounts doesn’t earn any interest. Venmo balances that are funded by credit cards are even worse as there are fees charged by multiple intermediaries. In the later case, interest earned by users is usually negligible, especially when taking into account inflation. Cash back or rewards programs can offer users incentives but high interest rates for missing payments are a strong disincentive to users.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Tomorrow’s peer-to-peer mobile payment application powered by OUSD will introduce the killer feature of double-digit yields. Our version of Venmo will combine the ease of peer-to-peer payments with a high-yield savings account that beats traditional savings accounts by a factor of 10 to 100x.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The OUSD payment app will be built with a centralized mobile app and APIs to minimize user friction for mainstream users. Users will be able to deposit USD and/or other fiat currencies to the app and enjoy the seamless user experiences of centralized applications. However, on the backend, these fiat deposits will be used to mint OUSD. New users will hold their balances in OUSD in Origin custodial wallets without needing to understand cryptocurrencies. They will simply be able to earn industry-leading yields when they are not spending. Again, your OUSD is always earning & ready to be spent or transferred at the same time.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The viral effects of the future OUSD payment app cannot be overstated. Payment apps are by nature already viral, with users onboarding their friends and family in order to transact with them, establishing powerful network effects. Merchants quickly adopt the payment services that attract the most users. By adding in the ability to earn yield the very instant that any new referred user accepts funds from a referring user, we believe the viral coefficient for existing users referring new users will be multiples higher than ever seen before in a traditional payments application.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The OUSD debit card will be tied to the future OUSD payment app and will allow users to spend down their on-app OUSD balance. Whenever users want to use their OUSD, their OUSD will be converted to USD via Visa’s interchange network and be instantly accepted by 40 million merchants all over the world. Merchants will receive USD and need not know that OUSD was used as the underlying original currency to power the transaction. Again, when users’ OUSD is not being spent, it will automatically accumulate staggering yields that should be superior to any cash bank or credit card rewards program in existence.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Although we plan on launching with hosted or managed wallets, we believe that users should be in control of their own funds if they do not want to use managed wallets. While the service that we build will be centralized at the application and middleware layer, the core protocol is decentralized. Users will be able to eject from the managed wallet at any point in time to simply hold their OUSD in their own self-managed wallets within the same app. We imagine that more and more users will gradually migrate from managed wallets to self-hosted wallets over time as they become educated about the benefits of underlying protocol.")}}</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">OUSD payments on traditional platforms</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Getting online and offline merchants to accept payments that are powered by OUSD rails is a monumental step. However, further down the road, an even more ambitious objective is to get merchants to accept OUSD directly.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The incentives to accept OUSD as a merchant over traditional credit cards or mobile payments is extremely compelling. Merchants can earn double-digit yields upon the sales of goods and services versus getting taxed with multiple payment fees.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The very first e-commerce platform to accept OUSD is Origin’s own Dshop platform. However, Dshop is a relatively new platform, and the majority of online e-commerce stores are run by incumbents like Shopify and Woo Commerce.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Thankfully, both Shopify and Woo Commerce have mature developer platforms and APIs. We intend to build applications on these existing platforms that allow merchants to accept OUSD directly from customers that want to pay with OUSD. These developer plugins are relatively simple to build, and there are many existing examples of working payment alternatives.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("For example, the Shopify app store currently already offers Coinbase Commerce, Bitpay, and GoCoin. We will release an OUSD payment app for merchants in the coming future.")}}</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">Cross-chain OUSD</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Given the recent surge in both the price of ETH and the usage of the Ethereum network, gas fees are becoming increasingly prohibitive and a major deterrent for getting the kind of retail adoption that we want.")}}</p>

")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("All of the yield for OUSD will continue to be generated on the Ethereum platform since that’s where the vast majority of capital and earning opportunities exist today. However, chain-specific versions of OUSD will be mintable by anyone who locks up OUSD in the cross-chain bridge. For example, you could lock 100 OUSD in the Solana bridge in order to generate 100 sOUSD which would be freely transferable within the Solana ecosystem. The original OUSD would stay locked in a smart contract where it would continue earning yield. Inside Solana, the circulating sOUSD tokens would rebase in lockstep with the OUSD that was locked in the smart contract. Anyone who wishes to exit would be able to redeem their sOUSD for the originally locked capital plus any yield that was generated while they were holding it.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("Through decentralized governance, the community will be able to adjust performance fee settings as well as other value accrual parameters.")}}</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For example, the community may vote for variable performance fees based on OUSD yield benchmarks (e.g. higher performance fees when OUSD is returning 50%%+ yields vs. 20%%+ yields). </li>
      <li>Other community-proposed models may include directing these performance fees to OGN holders directly as dividends to OGN holders.</li>
      <li>Additional models may reward larger fees to OGN holders that stake their tokens (e.g. OGN holders that stake for 3 months will receive more rewards than those that stake for 1 month)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>{{gettext("OGN holders are therefore incentivized to promote OUSD. As OUSD circulating supply increases, performance fees generated will also increase, directly benefiting OGN holders financially. The converse is also true. OUSD holders are incentivized to be OGN holders, so they can participate actively in the governance of the protocol. This creates a strong flywheel effect between Origin’s two tokens.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Since it is our intention to build powerful applications on top of the OUSD protocol like the new peer-to-peer payments product and debit card offering, we will also be able to create new monetization opportunities with these applications. For example, we may take a small percentage of OUSD yields as revenue to cover the costs of running the centralized infrastructure to power these experiences. Any profits that are generated off-chain can similarly be reinvested into the OGN buyback program or other fee distribution options mentioned above.    ")}}</p>
