  <p>{{gettext("We believe the convergence of peer-to-peer commerce, especially in the NFT vertical, and decentralized finance (DeFi) will unlock billions of dollars in value that we intend to capture as part of the Origin Platform and ecosystem.")}}</p>
  
  <p>{{gettext("To get there, we will bring blockchain-enabled commerce and finance to the masses. We will continue to improve Origin products to enable new killer use cases that are only made possible by cryptocurrency technologies. To start, we will take advantage of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to build new commerce experiences that cannot be replicated on incumbent platforms like Shopify, Amazon, or Alibaba.")}}</p>

  <p>{{gettext("In 2020 alone, over $250M in NFTs changed hands, with most of that occurring late in the year. The rate of growth in NFT sales and trade volume and the rate of innovation in the space is exponential. Top brands like the NBA and MLB have already gotten involved and everyone from Andreessen Horowitz from the New York Times is investing in or commenting on NFTs. NFTs have the potential to disrupt the music industry ($70B+ a year), fine art sales ($60B+ a year), video games ($140B+ a year), the collectibles market ($370B+ a year), and many other industries. NFTs represent a massive disruptive opportunity that can touch virtually every aspect of global culture and commerce.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("As of early 2021, NFTs have now overtaken DeFi on Google search trends and hold the kind of broad mainstream cultural appeal that other crypto verticals lack. This is a key factor that makes us believe NFTs will be the first product category that onboards mainstream users into crypto. The platform that is able to successfully onboard both creators and purchasers of NFTs will capture tremendous value. We intend to be that platform.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("In addition, we will make it dead simple for mainstream consumers to participate in DeFi yield earning strategies. Investors and lenders should be earning yields at 10 to 100 times (10-20%%) at what is offered currently by traditional banking systems. Borrowers should have easier access to credit to finance their investments, businesses, and other enterprises. Further, this all needs to happen in frictionless and easy ways that are in stark contrast to the product experiences of todayâ€™s first-generation DeFi products.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Similarly, we believe there needs to be more compelling reasons for consumers and merchants to use cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies for billion and trillion-dollar sized commerce opportunities to exist. Peer-to-peer and consumer-to-merchant cryptocurrency transactions need to be made far simpler than they are today. We need to propagate cryptocurrency payment rails that are superior to existing credit/debit cards and mobile payments that rely on fiat currencies and centralized systems.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("To realize our ambitious vision, we will continue to develop and grow the <a href='https://ousd.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Origin Dollar (OUSD)</a> as a critical DeFi building block and money lego that is highly composable. It will power multiple mainstream consumer and merchant applications in the near future. We anticipate millions of users to be using applications powered by OUSD in the next few years without necessarily even realizing they are using an underlying DeFi product.")}}</p>
