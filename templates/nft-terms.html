            <li><b>Dispute Resolution</b>. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Origin and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement</b>. All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Ts&Cs or the use of any product or service provided by the Origin that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the Ts&Cs of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Origin, and to any subsidiaries, Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Ts&Cs.</li>
                    <li><b>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution</b>. Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Origin should be sent to: Origin Protocol Labs P.O. Box 61, Harbour Centre George Town, Grand Cayman, KY1-1102 Cayman Islands. After the Notice is received, you and the Origin may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Origin do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</li>
                    <li><b>Arbitration Rules</b>. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Ts&Cs. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Origin made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Origin will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</li>
                    <li><b>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration</b>. If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Limits</b>. If you or the Origin pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</li>
                    <li><b>Authority of Arbitrator</b>. If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Origin, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Ts&Cs. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Origin.</li>
                    <li><b>Waiver of Jury Trial</b>. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Origin in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</li>
                    <li><b>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</b>. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</li>
                    <li><b>Confidentiality</b>. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce these Ts&Cs, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</li>
                    <li><b>Severability</b>. If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</li>
                    <li><b>Right to Waive</b>. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</li>
                    <li><b>Survival of Agreement</b>. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Origin.</li>
                    <li><b>Small Claims Court</b>.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Origin may bring an individual action in small claims court.</li>
                    <li><b>Emergency Equitable Relief</b>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</li>
                    <li><b>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration</b>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</li>
                    <li><b>Courts</b>. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Grand Caymans for such purpose.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Export</b>. The Platform may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Origin, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.</li>
            <li><b>Electronic Communications</b>. The communications between you and Origin use electronic means, whether you use the Platform or send us emails, or whether Origin posts notices on the Platform or communicates with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications from Origin in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all Ts&Cs and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Origin provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were be in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your non-waivable rights.</li>
            <li><b>Entire Ts&Cs</b>. These Ts&Cs constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Platform. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Ts&Cs shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Ts&Cs are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision of these Ts&Cs is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Ts&Cs will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Origin is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Ts&Cs, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Origin’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Origin may freely assign these Ts&Cs. The Ts&Cs and conditions set forth in these Ts&Cs shall be binding upon assignees.</li>
