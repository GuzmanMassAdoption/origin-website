Thanks for checking out Origin Protocol (https://www.originprotocol.com) and subscribing to our email list. We're excited to have you join us as we bring NFTs and DeFi to the masses.

Origin Dollar (https://ousd.com) is the first stablecoin that automatically earns a yield while in your wallet. 

Origin Story (https://story.xyz) is the NFT platform that allows creators to sell NFTs on their own terms and has powered multiple record-breaking NFT sales. 

OGN (https://www.originprotocol.com/dashboard) is the decentralized governance token for Origin Protocol and accrues value from yield generated by OUSD. Creators can launch NFTs on Origin Story for free in exchange for locking OGN. Origin was founded in 2017 by serial entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley and a PayPal founder and the first engineer at YouTube. You can buy OGN on Coinbase (https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/OGN-USD), Binance (https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=38914658), and other top exchanges.

If you have any questions or want to get involved, just hit reply on this email or reach out to us on Discord (https://www.originprotocol.com/discord).
